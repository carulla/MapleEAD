        <p> Brazil, 1999ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·<br>
            Creativity and communication have always been key points in my development, which led me to choose <strong>Journalism</strong> as my first area of training. In college, I had the opportunity to get to know the teaching practice more closely, I started working as an English Teacher and decided to enroll in a new degree: <strong>English Language and Arts</strong>. This awakened in me a new passion, <strong>education</strong>.<br><br>

I continue in constant training, in academic theory and professional practice, mixing communication and education in my projects.<br><br>
Another interest that came into my life later was learning to code and becoming a <strong>self-taught web developer</strong>. I was always fascinated by the possibilities of creating websites and applications that could reach millions of people around the world. I started to learn the basics of <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> online, using resources such as <strong>Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, and YouTube</strong>. I also joined online communities of fellow learners and developers, such as <strong>Stack Overflow, Dev.to, and GitHub</strong>. I learned how to use various tools and frameworks, such as <strong>Bootstrap, React, and Firebase</strong>, to create dynamic and responsive web pages and applications. I also learned how to debug, test, and deploy my projects using tools such as <strong>Chrome DevTools, Jest, and Netlify</strong>.
<br><br>
Learning to code and becoming a web developer has been a rewarding and challenging journey for me. It has allowed me to express my creativity, communicate my ideas, and solve problems in new ways. It has also opened up new opportunities for me, such as working as a freelance web developer, creating my own <strong>portfolio website</strong>, and participating in hackathons and online competitions. I am always eager to learn new skills and technologies, and to improve my existing ones. I believe that coding is not only a useful skill, but also a fun and enjoyable hobby.</p>
